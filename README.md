'Life History and Function Shape Patterns of Cultural Transmission' by Anne Kandler,  Rafael D'Andrea, James O'Dwyer

> *Abstract*: Biological and cultural evolution are deeply connected, offering opportunities for cross-disciplinary research. Models of neutral evolution can be used to generate insights into large-scale (non-neutral) mechanisms driving the evolutionary dynamic in cultural systems. Here, we combine neutrality with life history strategies and functional constraints to suggest cultural transmission processes that could explain deviations from neutral expectations in one of the best-documented cultural datasets—first name statistics. We show that the life history of first names, induced by age constraints in an unbiased transmission process, where parents primarily adopt names from young children rather than older children or adults, reproduces the power law distribution of first names seen in U.S. census data. Building on this, we introduce a neutral model that fits the distribution of all but the rarest names in first name datasets of different geographical regions. The model yields population-specific effective innovation rates that can offer insight into the cultural innovation process. In particular, we find a novel scaling relationship whereby larger populations have lower effective innovation rates. This may reflect a function of first names: they should be distinguishable within an individual’s social network, but less so at larger scales.

## Code

All code is implemented in Matlab. The script `main_ageSim.m` can be used to
generate populations using the simulation models described in the paper.
